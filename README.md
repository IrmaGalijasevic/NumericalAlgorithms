# Numerical Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various numerical algorithms used for solving mathematical problems, including root-finding methods (e.g. Newton-Raphson), interpolation techniques (e.g., Lagrange, Newton's divided difference), numerical integration (e.g., Trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule), and solutions for differential equations (e.g., Euler's method, Runge-Kutta). Each algorithm is implemented in [Your Programming Language], with clear documentation, examples, and test cases for easy understanding and usage.
